augmentedTi
===========

augmentedTi is an application which shows how to build an effective Augmented Reality Solution using Appcelerator Titanium.

It is released under the Apache Open Source License, you are free to use and manipulate this code as you require. If you have fixes or suggestions please contact me via trevor.ward@softlywired.com

The application is described below.

Version 1.0
___________

In this version the application checks the sensors on the device and uses google places to show the data in the Augmented Reality space.

It uses a plain black screen or the camera view if the camera exists for this and does no data update or altering the items (POI's) as you get closer or further away.

The next version will have the distance updates. It is not currently in this version as I thought it better to release early for feedback.

To use this application you will need to input your own Google Places API key in the googleFeed.js file.
